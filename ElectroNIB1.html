			<h1><span>About Site</span></h1>
			<p>Electronics has change the world.'Electro' mean in the field of electronics and 'NIB' mean a pointed or projecting part of an object. It's not just about Hardware and Software. Learning to <i>problem-solving skills</i> and a way to communicate with others on a technical level. I can also develop websites and use my skills to get a better job. And I learned it all at <strong>Arduino</strong> where they build your self-esteem and keep you motivated. Join me in this rewarding journey. You'll have fun, get help, and learn along the way!
